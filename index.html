    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>I currently have been working within private corrections for CoreCivic (previosuly known as Corrections Corporation of America).  I started as a coordinator in Operations Support department, offering support for the financial business operations and safety operations within the company.  I was promoted to oversee the Occupational Safety for all our Community Branch consisting of around 27 facilities and climbing.</p>
    <h4>Journey into Development</h4>
    <p>Why development? What do I love? I absolutely love to learn and software development ensures that I will spend the rest of my life continuing to learn new technologies and provide solutions to new problems.  I love the problem solving required in developing and look forward to solving many more problems in the future!</p>
