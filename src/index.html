        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          In April 2011, I began working at CoreCivic (previously known as Corrections Corporation of America) as a coordinator in Operations Support department.  I offered support for the financial business operations and occupational safety operations within the company.  A few years later, I was promoted to oversee the Occupational Safety for all our Community Branch consisting of around 27 facilities and climbing.  I am responsible for provideing guidance to these facilities in order to ensure their compliance with federal, state and local safety, health and environmental regulations.  I have led multiple leadership projects that furthered the operational goals for integrating community facilities into the current business portfolio and fostering a culture of communication and collaboration.

        <h2>Journey into Development</h2>
        <p>
          While I was working on finishing up my degree I took some brief certification courses with New Horizons.  I completed their Microsoft Office certification program and the A+ certification program.  Their program also allowed for you to add on an additional certification program.  My program of choice was to learn Miscrosoft's SQL.  I absolutely enjoyed this course but unfortunately due to life circumstances I was unable to continue down this path and gave it up before I was able to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a person who loves to learn and I truly never want to stop learning new things that I find interesting.  Because of this I decided to start developing.  I felt (and currently still feel) very stale in my current role and was looking for something that would exercise and challenge my mind.  I found this with coding.  I spoke with one of my friends and listened to him talking about his role and projects and it was fascinating.  He recommended Nashville Software School.  He also recommended that I could start trying it out through Udemy and Team Treehouse sites.  I immediately did all of those things and fell head over heels for software development.  I have found my passion and feel I am made to do this.  When coding it does not feel like workbut an enjoyable puzzle to be solved.  There will always be one more puzzle to be solved so I look forward to all of those in the future!
